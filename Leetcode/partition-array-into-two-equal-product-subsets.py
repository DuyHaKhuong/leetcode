Hint
You are given an integer array nums containing distinct positive integers and an integer target.

Determine if you can partition nums into two non-empty disjoint subsets, with each element belonging to exactly one subset, such that the product of the elements in each subset is equal to target.

Return true if such a partition exists and false otherwise.

A subset of an array is a selection of elements of the array.
